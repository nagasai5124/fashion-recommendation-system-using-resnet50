# fashion-recommendation-system-using-resnet50

• In this project, we proposed a personalized Fashion Recommender system that generates
recommendations for the user based on an image of a product
• The proposed approach uses a two-stage phase. Initially, our proposed approach extracts the embeddings of the image using CNN classifier. 
Later provide similar images present in database
we use resnet50 for image feature extraction and then convert them into embeddings 
Here are the key reasons to use ResNet for image classification:
1,Enables Deeper Networks: ResNet makes it possible to train networks with hundreds or even thousands of layers without performance degradation.
2,Improved Performance: By using residual learning, ResNet achieves better accuracy in tasks like image classification.
3,Better Generalization: The architecture helps avoid overfitting, improving model performance on unseen data.
